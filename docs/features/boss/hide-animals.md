# Hide Animals (F4)

The Floor 4 boss fight can fill the arena with a large number of non-hostile Spirit Animals, which can create visual clutter and make it difficult to see important enemies and mechanics. The Hide Animals feature provides a simple solution by allowing you to selectively hide the models of these animals, cleaning up your screen and allowing you to focus on the fight.

## Configuration

This feature provides a separate toggle for each type of Spirit Animal, giving you fine-grained control over what you see.

-   **Hide Sheep:** When enabled, all Spirit Sheep in the arena will be invisible.
-   **Hide Cows:** When enabled, all Spirit Cows in the arena will be invisible.
-   **Hide Chickens:** When enabled, all Spirit Chickens in the arena will be invisible.
-   **Hide Wolves:** When enabled, all Spirit Wolves in the arena will be invisible.
-   **Hide Rabbits:** When enabled, all Spirit Rabbits in the arena will be invisible.
