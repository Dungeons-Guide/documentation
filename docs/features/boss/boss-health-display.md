# Boss Health Display

Keeping track of the health of multiple enemies during a chaotic boss fight can be challenging. The Boss Health Display feature provides a clear, on-screen HUD element that shows the current health of all major bosses and mini-bosses in the arena, such as the Guardians in the Floor 7 boss fight or the Priests in Floor 6. This allows you to maintain situational awareness and prioritize targets effectively without needing to look directly at them.

## Configuration

You can customize how health information is presented to suit your preferences.

### Show total health
When this option is enabled, the display will show both the current and maximum health of an enemy (e.g., "5M / 10M"). If disabled, it will only show the current health, providing a cleaner, more compact view.

### Format health
To improve readability, enabling this option will format large health numbers into a more compact form (e.g., 1,234,567 will be displayed as "1.2M"). This can make the HUD element less cluttered and easier to read at a glance.

### Don't show health of in-attackable enemy
This option helps to reduce screen clutter by hiding the health bars of any bosses or mini-bosses that are currently invulnerable or cannot be attacked. This ensures that the display only shows actionable information, allowing you to focus on the targets that matter.
