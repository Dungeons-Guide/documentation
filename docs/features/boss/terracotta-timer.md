# Terracotta Timer (F6)

The terracotta phase of the Floor 6 boss fight is a timed section that can be stressful to manage. The Terracotta Timer feature provides a simple and clear HUD element that displays a countdown for this phase. This allows you to see at a glance how much time is remaining, helping you pace yourself and coordinate with your team to ensure the phase is completed successfully.

## Configuration

As a HUD element, the Terracotta Timer can be enabled or disabled in the configuration menu. Its primary customization options are available in the HUD editor, where you can freely change its position on the screen and adjust the text style, size, and color to perfectly match your user interface.
