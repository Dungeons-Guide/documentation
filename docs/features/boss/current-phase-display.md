# Current Phase Display

Boss fights in dungeons often have multiple, distinct phases with different mechanics. The Current Phase Display feature provides a simple but effective HUD element that shows the name of the current phase you are in (e.g., "crush," "terminals," "lasers"). This helps you and your team maintain situational awareness, anticipate upcoming mechanics, and execute the correct strategy for each stage of the fight.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element and can be enabled or disabled like any other. Its primary configuration is done through the HUD editor, where you can change its position on the screen and customize the text style (color, font, size) to match your personal UI layout.
