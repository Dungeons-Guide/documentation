# Auto Reparty

The Auto Reparty feature is a convenient quality-of-life utility that streamlines the process of starting a new dungeon run. When enabled, the mod will automatically handle the administrative task of disbanding your current party and reinviting all the members as soon as your dungeon run concludes. This allows you and your team to get into the next run faster, without the need for a party leader to manually type the commands each time.

## Configuration

### Enabled
This feature is a simple toggle. Due to its nature of automating chat commands, it is disabled by default. Please be aware that while such features are common, they exist in a gray area regarding Hypixel's rules. Use this feature at your own risk.
