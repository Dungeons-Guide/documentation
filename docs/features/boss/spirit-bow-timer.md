# Spirit Bow Timer (F4)

The Spirit Bow is a key item in the Floor 4 boss fight, but it only exists for a limited time after being picked up. The Spirit Bow Timer feature provides a crucial HUD element that displays a countdown, showing you exactly how much time is left before the bow disintegrates. This helps you make the most of this powerful weapon, ensuring you can land your shots before it disappears.

## Configuration

As a HUD element, the Spirit Bow Timer can be enabled or disabled in the mod's configuration menu. Its visual appearance can be fully customized through the HUD editor, which allows you to move it anywhere on your screen and change the text's style, color, and size to best suit your needs.
