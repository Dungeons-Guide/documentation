# F7 Terminal Waypoints

The terminal phase of the Floor 7 boss fight can be a hectic and confusing part of the run. The F7 Terminal Waypoints feature provides a powerful set of visual aids to help your team navigate this phase efficiently. It renders customizable waypoints and status indicators on all the terminals, ensuring everyone knows where to go and what to do.

## Configuration

This feature offers a high degree of customization to help you tailor the display to your needs.

### Highlight waypoints in world
This is the main toggle for the feature. When enabled, it will draw a colored highlight box around each terminal, making them easy to spot within the boss arena.

### Enable beacon beam
For even greater visibility, you can enable this option to add a vertical beacon beam effect to each waypoint. This is particularly useful for spotting terminals from a long distance or across the room.

### Beam Color & Target Color
These options allow you to customize the color of both the beacon beam and the highlight box around the terminal. You can choose colors that stand out best against the background of the boss arena.

### Render terminal status on beacon
This setting adds useful text information to each waypoint, showing its current status. The text will indicate whether a terminal is "Done," "Incomplete," or if a specific player is currently near it, which helps with team coordination and prevents multiple players from going to the same terminal.

### Only render current sub-phase
To reduce screen clutter, you can enable this option to only show waypoints for the terminals that are active in the current sub-phase of the fight. If disabled, all terminals on the floor will be shown at once.
