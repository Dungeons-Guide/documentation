# Box Real Livid

In the Floor 5 boss fight, the Livid boss creates numerous clones of himself, making it difficult to identify the real one. The Box Real Livid feature solves this problem by drawing a distinct, colored box around the one true Livid. This allows you to instantly identify and target the correct enemy, saving time and preventing wasted damage on the clones.

## Configuration

### Highlight Color
This option allows you to customize the color of the box that highlights the real Livid. You can choose a color that is highly visible to you, ensuring that the real Livid stands out clearly from the crowd of clones.
