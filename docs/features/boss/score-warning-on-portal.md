# Score Warning on Watcher Portal

Before entering the boss fight, it's crucial to know if your team is on track for a high score. The Score Warning on Watcher Portal feature provides a comprehensive summary of your run's progress, displayed directly on the portal to the boss room. This summary includes warnings for critical issues like undiscovered rooms or failed puzzles, as well as a detailed breakdown of your score estimate, including secrets found, crypts, deaths, and time. This allows your team to make an informed decision about whether to proceed to the boss or go back to find more secrets.

## Configuration

This feature can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its appearance is highly customizable through a dedicated text style editor. This allows you to change the color, font, and size of different parts of the warning message, such as the main warning text, the field names (e.g., "Total Secrets"), and the values, ensuring the information is presented in a way that is clear and readable for you.
