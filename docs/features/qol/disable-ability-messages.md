# Disable Ability Messages

Certain item abilities can spam the chat with messages, such as notifying you that you were hit for a certain amount of damage. While sometimes useful, these messages can quickly clutter your chat and obscure more important information from your party members. The Disable Ability Messages feature provides a simple solution by filtering out and hiding these specific messages, leading to a cleaner and more readable chat experience.

## Configuration

This feature is a simple toggle that can be enabled or disabled in the configuration menu. There are no other settings to configure.
