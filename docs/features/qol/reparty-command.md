# Reparty Command

Manually disbanding and re-forming a party between dungeon runs can be a tedious process. The Reparty Command feature streamlines this by providing a simple and convenient chat command: `/reparty`. When executed by the party leader, this command will instantly disband the current party and reinvite all the previous members, saving time and effort and allowing your team to get into the next run more quickly.

## Configuration

This feature is a simple command that can be enabled or disabled. When enabled, the `/reparty` command becomes available for use. There are no other configuration options.
