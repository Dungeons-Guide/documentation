# Low-Health Warning

In the chaos of a dungeon, it can be easy to lose track of your teammates' health. The Low-Health Warning feature acts as a safety net by providing a clear, on-screen alert whenever a player in your party drops below 500 HP. The warning displays the player's name and their remaining health, allowing you to quickly identify a teammate in trouble and provide support, potentially preventing a death.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element and can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its position on the screen and the style of the text (color, font, size) can be fully customized in the HUD editor, ensuring that this critical warning is always visible to you.
