# Highlight Starred Mobs

In a room filled with enemies, it can be difficult to distinguish the normal mobs from the more dangerous, "starred" variants. The Highlight Starred Mobs feature provides a crucial visual aid by applying a customizable highlight to these priority targets. This allows you to quickly identify and focus down the most significant threats in a room, improving your efficiency and survivability.

## Configuration

You can tailor the appearance of the highlight to make it as noticeable as possible.

### Enabled
This allows you to toggle the feature on or off.

### Highlight Color
This option lets you choose the color of the highlight that is applied to starred mobs. Selecting a bright and easily recognizable color is recommended to ensure these dangerous enemies never go unnoticed.
