# Box Skeleton Masters

Skeleton Masters are a high-priority threat in dungeons, capable of dealing significant damage. The Box Skeleton Masters feature helps you to quickly identify and target these dangerous mobs by drawing a colored box around them. This makes them stand out from the crowd of other skeletons and zombies, allowing you to prioritize them and neutralize the threat more effectively.

## Configuration

The appearance of the highlight box can be customized to suit your preferences.

### Enabled
This allows you to toggle the feature on or off.

### Box Color
You can choose the color of the highlight box, ensuring that it is easily visible against the varied environments of the dungeon and doesn't blend in with other visual effects.
