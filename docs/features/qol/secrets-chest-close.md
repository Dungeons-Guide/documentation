# Secrets Chest Close

Opening a secret chest and manually closing the GUI can be a small but repetitive interruption to the flow of a dungeon run. The Secrets Chest Close feature is a simple quality-of-life improvement that streamlines this process. When this feature is enabled, you can instantly close any secret chest you have opened by simply pressing any key on your keyboard. This allows you to grab the loot and get back to the action with minimal delay.

## Configuration

This feature has a single toggle to turn it on or off. There are no other configuration options.
