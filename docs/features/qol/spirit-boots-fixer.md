# Spirit Boots Fixer

A well-known and frustrating bug can occur when using Spirit Boots, where activating their ability causes the item in your hand to seemingly disappear, replaced by air. The Spirit Boots Fixer is a simple, background feature that corrects this visual glitch. When enabled, it automatically prevents this bug from happening, ensuring your held item remains visible and accessible after you use the boots' ability.

## Configuration

This is a set-and-forget feature. It has a single toggle to turn it on or off, with no other configuration needed.
