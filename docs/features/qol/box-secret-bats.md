# Box Secret Bats

Secret bats can be small, fast-moving, and difficult to spot, especially in dimly lit rooms. The Box Secret Bats feature makes them significantly easier to see by drawing a colored box around each one. This visual aid helps the bats stand out from the environment, allowing you to quickly locate and eliminate them to collect your secret. It's important to note that this feature is purely visual and does not alter the bats' hitboxes in any way.

## Configuration

### Enabled
This allows you to toggle the feature on or off.

### Box Color
You can customize the color of the highlight box to ensure it is highly visible against the various backgrounds of the dungeon rooms. Choosing a bright, contrasting color is recommended.
