# Ability Cooldown Display

Many powerful items in dungeons have abilities with significant cooldowns. Keeping track of these timers mentally can be difficult, especially during intense combat. The Ability Cooldown Display provides a clear, on-screen HUD element that shows a timer for your item abilities, ensuring you always know when you can use them again. This helps you optimize your damage output and utility usage without having to guess if an ability is ready.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its appearance and location can be fully customized through the HUD editor, allowing you to change its on-screen position and adjust the text style, color, and size to seamlessly integrate with your existing UI setup.
