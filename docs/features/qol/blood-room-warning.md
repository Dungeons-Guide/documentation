# Blood Room Warning

The "Blood Room" (the entrance to the boss fight) is a point of no return. Entering it too early can jeopardize your chances of getting a high score. The Blood Room Warning feature provides a critical HUD element that displays your dungeon's progress and gives a clear warning if you should not yet proceed. This helps prevent common mistakes like entering the boss room before all puzzles are complete or all necessary secrets have been found.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its on-screen position and the style of the text (color, font, size) can be fully customized in the HUD editor, allowing you to place this important warning wherever it is most visible to you.
