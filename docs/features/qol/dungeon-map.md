# Dungeon Map

The in-game dungeon map can be difficult to read and lacks detailed information. The Dungeon Map feature provides a much-improved, custom map overlay that gives you a clear and comprehensive view of the entire dungeon. This enhanced map not only shows the full layout, but also displays the completion progress of each room, the current positions of your teammates, and the total number of secrets contained within each room. This makes it an invaluable tool for navigation, coordination, and ensuring you never miss a secret.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element and can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. As a core visual component, it can be fully customized through the HUD editor. You can change its size and position on your screen to ensure it is placed conveniently for you, and you can also adjust the style of the map's various text elements to your liking.
