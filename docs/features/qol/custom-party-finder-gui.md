# Custom Party Finder GUI

The default Party Finder interface can be clunky and difficult to navigate. The Custom Party Finder GUI feature replaces the standard interface with a redesigned, more user-friendly version. This custom GUI provides a cleaner layout and a more intuitive experience, making it easier and faster to find and manage your dungeon parties.

## Configuration

This feature can be enabled or disabled in the configuration menu. When enabled, it will automatically replace the default Party Finder GUI. There are no other specific options to configure.
