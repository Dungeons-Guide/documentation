# Dungeon Death Indicator

Deaths can significantly impact your final score in a dungeon run. The Dungeon Death Indicator is a HUD element that keeps a running tally of the deaths in your party. It displays the name of each player who has died, how many times they have died, and the total number of deaths for the entire party. This provides a clear, at-a-glance summary of your team's performance and helps you understand how your final score is being affected.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. You can fully customize its on-screen position and the style of its text (color, font, size) through the HUD editor, ensuring the information is displayed in a way that is convenient and readable for you.
