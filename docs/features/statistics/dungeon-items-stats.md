# Dungeon Items Stats

The Dungeon Items Stats feature adds valuable context to the tooltips of items obtained from dungeons. When enabled, it will display additional information about the item, including the specific dungeon floor it originated from and its quality, shown as a percentage. This can be useful for collectors, for understanding the value of an item, or for simply keeping track of where your gear came from.

## Configuration

This is a simple feature that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. There are no other specific options to configure.
