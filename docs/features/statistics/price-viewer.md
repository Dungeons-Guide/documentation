# Price Viewer

Understanding the value of an item is key to managing your wealth in Skyblock. The Price Viewer feature provides a convenient tooltip that displays the current market value of any item you hover over. It shows both the current Buy It Now (BIN) price and the average Auction House (AH) price, giving you a quick and accurate snapshot of an item's worth without needing to check the Auction House manually. This helps you make informed decisions about what to keep, what to sell, and what to buy.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its appearance can be customized in the HUD editor, which allows you to adjust the on-screen position and the text style (color, font, size) to your preference.
