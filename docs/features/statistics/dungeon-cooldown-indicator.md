# Dungeon Cooldown Indicator

After leaving a dungeon, there is a 20-second cooldown period before you can start a new run. The Dungeon Cooldown Indicator is a simple HUD element that displays a timer for this cooldown. This allows you to see exactly when you are able to queue for the next dungeon, helping to streamline the process of chain-running dungeons with your party.

## Configuration

As a HUD element, this feature can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its visual appearance and on-screen location can be fully customized through the HUD editor, allowing you to change the text style, color, size, and position to fit your needs.
