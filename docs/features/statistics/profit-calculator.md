# Profit Calculator

Deciding whether to open a dungeon chest can be a gamble. The Profit Calculator feature takes the guesswork out of this decision by providing a clear, on-screen HUD element that shows you the potential profit or loss of opening the chest in front of you. It analyzes the value of the items inside and compares it to the cost of opening the chest, giving you an instant calculation to help you make smarter economic choices.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. You can fully customize its on-screen position and the style of its text (color, font, size) through the HUD editor, ensuring the information is displayed in a way that is convenient and readable for you.
