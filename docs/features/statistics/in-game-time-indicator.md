# In-Game Time Indicator

While the Real-Time Indicator shows the actual time elapsed, the In-Game Time Indicator displays the official time that Hypixel has recorded for your dungeon run. This is the time that ultimately determines your score for the "Time" category. This HUD element allows you to see this crucial value at a glance, without needing to open any menus, helping you to pace your run effectively to achieve a better score.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element and can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. You can fully customize its on-screen position and the style of its text (color, font, size) through the HUD editor, ensuring the information is displayed in a way that is convenient and readable for you.
