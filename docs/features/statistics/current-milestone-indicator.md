# Current Milestone Indicator

Reaching new milestones in dungeons is a key part of progression. The Current Milestone Indicator is a HUD element that keeps you informed of your progress by displaying the current milestone you have achieved for the dungeon floor you are playing. This allows you to see your accomplishments at a glance without needing to check your stats manually after the run.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. You can fully customize its on-screen position and the style of its text (color, font, size) through the HUD editor to ensure it is displayed in a way that is convenient for you.
