# View Room Name

Knowing the specific name of the room you are in can be useful for callouts and for understanding the dungeon layout. The View Room Name feature provides a simple HUD element that displays the name of your current room in the dungeon. This saves you from having to guess or remember the name of every room, providing a convenient at-a-glance reference.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element and can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its position on the screen, as well as the color, size, and style of the text, can be fully customized in the HUD editor to match your personal UI preferences.
