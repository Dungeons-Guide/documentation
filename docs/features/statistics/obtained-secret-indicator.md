# Obtained Secret Indicator

Maximizing your score often comes down to finding all the secrets in a dungeon. The Obtained Secret Indicator is a simple but essential HUD element that shows you how many secrets have been found so far, as well as the total number of secrets that exist in the current dungeon. This is displayed as a clear "found / total" fraction, giving you an immediate understanding of your team's progress and how many secrets are still left to be discovered.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. You can fully customize its on-screen position and the style of its text (color, font, size) through the HUD editor to ensure it integrates perfectly with your UI.
