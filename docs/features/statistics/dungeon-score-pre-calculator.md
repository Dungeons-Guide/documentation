# Dungeon Score Pre-Calculator

Achieving a high score, particularly an S+, is a primary goal of any dungeon run. The Dungeon Score Pre-Calculator is a powerful HUD element that helps you track your progress towards this goal in real-time. It provides a live estimate of your final score based on your current performance. More importantly, it tells you exactly how many more secrets you need to find to advance to the next score rank (e.g., from S to S+), allowing you to make informed decisions about whether to continue searching for secrets or proceed to the boss.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. You can fully customize its on-screen position and the style of its text (color, font, size) through the HUD editor, ensuring this vital information is always clearly visible to you.
