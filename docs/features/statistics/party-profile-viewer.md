# Party Profile Viewer

When evaluating potential party members, it's essential to have quick access to their key statistics. The Party Profile Viewer provides a powerful, integrated way to inspect a player's profile directly from the chat. By simply hovering over the "view" button next to a player's name, you can see a detailed tooltip that displays their equipped armor, total secrets found, Lily weight, talismans, and a selection of other useful statistics. This allows you to quickly assess a player's experience and gear without needing to visit their profile manually.

## Configuration

This feature can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its primary setting allows you to choose which additional statistics are displayed in the profile tooltip. This customization is handled through the mod's main GUI, giving you control over what information is most important to you when building a party.
