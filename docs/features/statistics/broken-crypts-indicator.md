# Broken Crypts Indicator

The number of broken crypts in a run contributes to your final score. While this information is available in the tab list, checking it requires an extra key press and can interrupt your gameplay. The Broken Crypts Indicator provides a convenient HUD element that displays the current number of broken crypts directly on your screen, giving you the same information as the tab list without the hassle.

## Configuration

As a HUD element, this feature can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its position on the screen, as well as the color, size, and style of the text, can be fully customized in the HUD editor to match your personal UI preferences.
