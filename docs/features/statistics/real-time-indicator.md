# Real-Time Indicator

The Real-Time Indicator is a straightforward and useful HUD element that displays a simple timer, showing you exactly how much real-world time has passed since you began the current dungeon run. This can be helpful for tracking your clear times, for speedrunning, or for simply being aware of how long a run is taking.

## Configuration

As a HUD element, this feature can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its visual appearance and on-screen location can be fully customized through the HUD editor, allowing you to change the text style, color, size, and position to fit your needs.
