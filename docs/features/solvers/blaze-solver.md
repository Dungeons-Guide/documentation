# Blaze Solver

The Blaze Solver is an essential tool for navigating one of the more chaotic puzzle rooms in the dungeons. When activated, this feature provides clear, real-time guidance on the correct sequence for dispatching the blazes, removing the guesswork and allowing for a faster and more efficient room clear. The solver highlights the blazes in different colors to indicate their priority, ensuring you always know which target to focus on next.

## Configuration

To tailor the visual cues to your preference, the Blaze Solver offers several color customization options.

### Normal Blaze Color
This setting determines the color of the highlight for all blazes that are not part of the immediate solution. You can set this to a more subdued color to help the primary targets stand out.

### Next Blaze Color
This is the most critical setting, as it controls the highlight color for the very next blaze you need to kill. A bright, distinct color is recommended to make your next target immediately obvious in the heat of battle.

### Next Up Blaze Color
To help you plan a step ahead, this option sets the color for the blaze that will become the primary target *after* you've killed the current one. This allows for smoother transitions between targets.

### Blaze Border Color
This option allows you to configure the color of the outline drawn around the highlight box for all blazes, which can help improve visibility against different backgrounds.
