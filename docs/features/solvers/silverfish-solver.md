# Silverfish Solver

The Silverfish puzzle requires players to hit the silverfish in a specific direction to guide it towards a target. The Silverfish Solver removes the trial-and-error from this task by drawing a clear line on the screen, indicating the optimal path and direction in which to hit the silverfish. This ensures a quick and efficient solution to the puzzle every time.

## Configuration

You can customize the appearance of the solution path to make it as clear as possible in the often chaotic environment of the puzzle room.

### Line Color
This option allows you to set the color of the line that shows the correct path. Choosing a distinct and bright color will help it stand out from the room's background and other visual effects.

### Line Thickness
This setting lets you adjust the thickness of the solution line, making it more or less prominent based on your personal preference and screen resolution. A thicker line can be easier to follow at a glance.
