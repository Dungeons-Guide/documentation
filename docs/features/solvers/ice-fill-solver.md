# Ice Fill Solver

The Ice Fill Solver provides a clear and easy-to-follow guide through the treacherous ice puzzle. Instead of guessing and slipping, this feature draws a distinct line on the screen, showing you the exact path to take to solve the puzzle correctly on the first try. This saves valuable time and eliminates a common point of frustration in dungeon runs.

## Configuration

You can customize the appearance of the solution path to ensure it is clearly visible in any situation.

### Line Color
This option allows you to choose the color of the line that indicates the correct path. It's recommended to select a bright, vibrant color that stands out against the icy blue of the puzzle room.

### Line Thickness
With this setting, you can adjust the thickness of the solution line. A thicker line can be easier to see, especially at higher screen resolutions or for players who prefer more prominent visual cues.
