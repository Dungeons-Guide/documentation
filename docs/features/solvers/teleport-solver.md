# Teleport Solver

The teleport maze puzzle can be a disorienting experience, requiring players to remember which pads they have already visited. The Teleport Solver simplifies this process by keeping track of the pads you've used. It highlights the teleport pads with different colors, allowing you to distinguish between the correct solution path and the pads you have already stepped on but which are not part of the solution. This visual aid helps you navigate the maze efficiently without getting lost.

## Configuration

The solver's visual cues can be customized to ensure they are clear and intuitive for you.

### Solution Color
This option sets the color of the highlight for the teleport pad that is part of the correct solution path.

### Not-Solution Color
This setting controls the color of the highlight for teleport pads that you have already visited but which are not part of the correct solution. This helps you avoid retreading incorrect paths.
