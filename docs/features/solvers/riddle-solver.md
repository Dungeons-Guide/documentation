# Riddle Solver

The three-person riddle puzzle requires players to listen to the statements of three NPCs and determine which one is telling the truth. The Riddle Solver automates this process. After you have clicked on all three NPCs to gather their statements, the solver will automatically identify the correct character to talk to, highlighting them with a colored box. This removes the need for manual deduction and speeds up the completion of this common puzzle room.

## Configuration

### Target Color
This option allows you to customize the color of the highlight box that appears around the correct NPC. You can choose a color that is easily visible to you, ensuring you can quickly identify the right character and complete the puzzle.
