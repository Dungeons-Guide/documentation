# Tic-Tac-Toe Solver

The Tic-Tac-Toe puzzle room challenges players to beat or draw against a surprisingly competent AI opponent. The Tic-Tac-Toe Solver provides a significant advantage by showing you the optimal move to make at every step of the game. It highlights the best square to choose, ensuring you can secure a win or a draw and complete the puzzle quickly and reliably.

## Configuration

The solver uses different colors to highlight the recommended move, and you can customize these to your liking.

### Your Turn Color
This option sets the color of the highlight box that appears on the board during your turn, indicating the best possible move you can make.

### Enemy Turn Color
This setting controls the color of the highlight box that appears during the AI's turn. This can be useful for analysis or for understanding the board state even when it's not your move.
