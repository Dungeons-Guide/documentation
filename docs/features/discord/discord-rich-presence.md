# Discord Rich Presence

The Discord Rich Presence feature integrates your Dungeons Guide experience directly with your Discord profile. When enabled, it will display detailed information about your current in-game status, such as your location, party details, and other relevant data, to your friends on Discord. This feature also includes an "Ask to Join" functionality, allowing other players to request to join your party directly through the Discord interface, making it easier than ever to team up.

## Configuration

This feature can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. The "Ask to Join" functionality can also be toggled separately through the in-game UI, giving you full control over whether you want to receive party requests from Discord.
