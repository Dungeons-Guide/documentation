# Friend Online Notification

The Friend Online Notification feature helps you stay connected with your friends who also use Dungeons Guide. When enabled, this feature will display a small, non-intrusive notification on your screen whenever one of your Discord friends launches Minecraft with the Dungeons Guide mod active. This makes it easy to see when your friends are online and ready to play, allowing you to team up without having to constantly check your friends list.

## Configuration

This feature is a HUD element that can be enabled or disabled in the main configuration menu. Its position on the screen can be fully customized through the HUD editor, allowing you to place the notification wherever it is most convenient for you. You can also adjust the text style, color, and size to match your personal UI preferences.
