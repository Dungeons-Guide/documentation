# Player Model

The Player Model feature provides the ultimate level of cosmetic customization, allowing you to change your in-game player model to one of several unique options. This cosmetic change is visible to all other players who are also using the Dungeons Guide mod, giving you a distinct and recognizable appearance within the community.

## Configuration

This feature is configured through a special, dedicated model selection widget within the mod's main graphical user interface. This provides a visual way to preview and select the player model that best suits your style.
