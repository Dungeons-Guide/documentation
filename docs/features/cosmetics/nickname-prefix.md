# Nickname Prefix

The Nickname Prefix feature offers another layer of cosmetic customization for your in-game identity. This option allows you to choose from a selection of unique prefixes that will appear before your username in chat. This prefix is visible to all other players who are also using the Dungeons Guide mod, allowing you to further personalize your appearance within the community.

## Configuration

Similar to the Nickname Color, this feature is not configured with a simple toggle. Instead, you can choose your desired prefix from a list within a special, dedicated prefix selection widget in the mod's main graphical user interface.
