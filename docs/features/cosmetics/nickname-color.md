# Nickname Color

The Nickname Color feature allows you to add a touch of personality to your in-game identity. This cosmetic option lets you select a custom color for your Minecraft username, which will be visible to all other players who are also using the Dungeons Guide mod. This allows you to stand out in chat and express your individual style within the Dungeons Guide community.

## Configuration

This feature does not use a standard configuration toggle. Instead, the color for your nickname is chosen through a special, dedicated color selection widget within the mod's main graphical user interface. This provides a rich, interactive way to select the perfect shade.
