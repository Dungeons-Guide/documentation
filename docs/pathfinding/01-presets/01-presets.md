# Introduction

### What is Pathfind Presets?

Pathfind Preset is a setting in Dungeons Guide that contains
- Default ability settings (Stonks / Etherwarps etc..)
- Precalculation links
- Internal TSP Cache for smart route
- Room Ability Settings override (For example trap rooms have etherwarp disabled)

Pathfind Presets can be viewed at `/dg -> Pathfinding & Secrets -> Precalculations`

Pathfind presets can be [imported](./import-preset) and [exported](./export-preset) as zip.

Multiple presets can be added to Dungeons Guide but only one can be used.
